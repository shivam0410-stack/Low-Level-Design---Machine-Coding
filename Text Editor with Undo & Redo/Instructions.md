Build an in-memory text editor that stores text by rows (lines) and supports insertion, deletion, and history navigation via undo/redo.

The document starts with zero rows and each row starts with zero columns (length = 0). Rows and columns are 0-indexed. Text never contains newline characters. Each operation targets one row.
Methods
1) void addText(int row, int column, String text)
Insert text into the specified row at position column.
Existing characters at/after column shift right.
Input rules:
text contains only: letters  [a-z], [A-Z] , space ' ', hyphen -.
0 ≤ row ≤ current row count.
If row == current row count, first append a new empty row, then insert (you cannot skip rows).
0 ≤ column ≤ current column count of the target row (after creating it if new).
text.length ≥ 1.
Effects: only the targeted row changes.
This operation pushes one entry onto the Undo history.
After any successful addText, the Redo history is cleared.
2) void deleteText(int row, int startColumn, int length)
Delete exactly length characters from row, starting at startColumn.
Input rules:
0 ≤ row < current row count.
1 ≤ length.
0 ≤ startColumn + length ≤ current column count of that row.
Effects: only the targeted row changes, empty rows remain (row count does not decrease).
This operation pushes one entry onto the Undo history.
After any successful deleteText, the Redo history is cleared.
3) void undo()
Revert the most recent change (addText or deleteText) that has not yet been undone.
If there is no change to undo, undo() is a no-op.
The reverted change is pushed onto the Redo stack.
4) void redo()
Reapply the most recently undone change.
If no undone change exists, redo() is a no-op.
After any new edit (addText or deleteText) since the last undo(), the Redo stack is cleared and redo() will have no effect until another undo().
The reapplied change is pushed back onto the Undo stack.
5) String readLine(int row)
Return the entire content of the specified row.
Rules:  0 ≤ row < current row count.
Returns "" if the row exists but is currently empty.
Hint: Use command design pattern and stacks to implement undo and redo operations.
Assumptions
All inputs respect constraints (no need to handle invalid indices).
Document may contain empty rows; these are valid and readable ("").
No trimming or normalization; spaces and hyphens are preserved exactly.
Examples
Assume the editor starts with 0 rows.

Example 1 - Creating Rows and Appending Text
addText(0, 0, "hello") → creates row 0 with hello
readLine(0) → hello
addText(1, 0, "world") → appends new row 1 with world
readLine(1) → world
Example 2 - Insert in Middle, Delete, Undo/Redo
(Starting rows) 0: "hello, 1: "world
addText(0, 5, "-there") → row 0 becomes hello-there
readLine(0) → hello-there
deleteText(0, 5, 6) → delete -there, row 0 becomes hello
readLine(0) → hello
undo() → restore -there, row 0: hello-there
readLine(0) → hello-there
redo() → re-apply delete, row 0: hello
readLine(0) → hello
Example 3 - Insert into Middle of Line
(Start) row 1 = world
addText(1, 5, "-wide web") → row 1 becomes world-wide web
readLine(1) → world-wide web
deleteText(1, 5, 5) → delete -wide, row 1: world web
undo() → restore -wide, row 1: world-wide web
readLine(1) → world-wide web
Example 4 - Multiple Undos, Redo Cleared by New Edit
(Start) row 0 = hello
addText(0, 5, "!") → hello!
addText(0, 6, "!") → hello!!
undo() → revert second add → hello!
undo() → revert first add → hello
redo() → reapply first add → hello!
addText(0, 6, "?") → hello!? (clears Redo)
redo() → no-op (Redo is empty)
readLine(0) → hello!?
Example 5 - Deleting From Start, Empty Row Persists
addText(0, 0, "aa bb-cc") → row 0: aa bb-cc
deleteText(0, 0, 8) → delete entire content, row 0: 
readLine(0) → 
undo() → restore aa bb-cc
readLine(0) → aa bb-cc
Example 6 - Inserting at Column 0 (Prefix Insert)
addText(1, 0, "world") → row 1: world
addText(1, 0, "hello-") → insert at start, row 1: hello-world
readLine(1) → hello-world
