30. Design a File System (cd with '*')

Design and implement an in-memory unix filesystem shell that supports three commands:
- mkdir <path>,
- pwd, and
- cd <path> (with a special wildcard segment *).
Scope & Environment
Start in the root directory /.
Paths can be absolute (start with /) or relative (no leading /).
Path separator is /. Multiple consecutive slashes should be treated as a single /.
Valid path segments are arbitrary non-empty strings except . and .. which have standard semantics:
. = current directory
.. = parent directory (root’s parent is itself)
Methods
1) String pwd()
returns the absolute path of the current directory.
Root returns / (no trailing slash).
For non-root: join segments with / (no trailing slash), e.g. /a/b/c
2) void mkdir(String path)
Create the final directory in <path>.
If <path> is absolute, creation is anchored at /.
If <path> is relative, creation is anchored at the current directory.
path will only contain: ( . , .. , a-z, / ). It will never contain *
Parents auto-created (like mkdir -p): missing intermediate segments are created.
Creating an already-existing directory is a no-op (idempotent).
It is not valid to create . or .. as literal directory names in <path>.
3) void cd(String path)
Change the current directory to <path>.
Accept both absolute and relative paths.
Normalize . and .. while traversing.
If any segment in traversal does not resolve to an existing directory, the command fails and the current directory remains unchanged.
Special wildcard segment: *
* is allowed as a path segment and matches exactly one segment at that position.
Match set (at that traversal point): { ".", ".." } ∪ { all direct child directory names }.
Deterministic choice rule
(to guarantee a working solution):
Prefer a child directory; if multiple, pick the lexicographically smallest child name.
If no child directories exist, prefer . (no-op).
If still applicable, fall back to .. (root’s parent is root).
Rationale: cd operates on a single path; expanding * to multiple candidates is not a viable cd behavior.
The above rule enforces a single, repeatable resolution.
Examples:
Start state:

CWD: /
pwd → /
mkdir /a/b/c

Creates /a, /a/b, /a/b/c (parents auto-created).
pwd → /
cd a/b

CWD: /a/b
pwd → /a/b
cd *

At /a/b, children = { c }.
Match set = { ., .., c }.
Prefer child → c.
CWD: /a/b/c
cd ../*

From /a/b/c, first .. → /a/b.
Now * at /a/b: prefer child c.
CWD: /a/b/c (unchanged effectively).
cd / * (space added for readability; equivalent to cd /*)

At /, if there are children (e.g., a), * chooses lexicographically smallest child (e.g., a), so CWD becomes /a.
If / has no children:

cd * at / → no children, prefer . → stay at /.
Error case:

cd /nope/*/x where /nope doesn’t exist → fail, CWD unchanged.
